## Introduction

Welcome to the CodeFlash Optimize-Me Repository!

This repository contains code ready for optimization. Clone or fork it, then run CodeFlash to see how it analyzes your code, suggests improvements, and integrates with your workflow through pull requests.

## What is CodeFlash?

CodeFlash helps you find ways to optimize your code. It improves performance, reduces resource usage, and enhances code efficiency. You can use it to optimize algorithms, speed up mathematical computations, and make data handling more efficient with NumPy and Pandas.

## Installation

### CodeFlash

```bash
pip install codeflash
```

### This Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeflash-ai/optimize-me.git
cd optimize-me
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Using CodeFlash

Run CodeFlash on your Python scripts with a simple command:

```bash
codeflash --all
```

CodeFlash will find potential optimization opportunities. You can then improve your code and check the results by running CodeFlash again.

## Expected Workflow

1. **Identify**: Use CodeFlash to spot optimization opportunities
2. **Optimize**: Apply the suggested improvements

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on contributing optimization examples and modules.

## Installation
