# Project Introduction

This project consists of various Python modules that handle different aspects of mathematical computations and data processing. The modules are organized in a way to focus on specific operations such as matrix operations, statistical functions, signal processing, dataframe operations, and numerical methods.

# Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, please run the following commands:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

These packages are essential for performing numerical and data manipulation tasks efficiently.

# Usage Instructions

Here's how you can import and use functions from these modules:

```python
from matrix_operations import numpy_matmul, dot_product
from statistical_functions import pca, kmeans_clustering
from signal_processing import FFT, gaussian_blur
from dataframe_operations import dataframe_filter, groupby_mean
from numerical_methods import numerical_integration_rectangle, newton_raphson_sqrt
```

Once imported, you can simply call these functions with the required parameters to perform the desired operations.
